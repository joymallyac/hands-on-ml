rows are data and columns are attributes/features

For any historical data, you cant do k-fold cross-validation.

Stratified k-fold is better than normal (even randomized ) k-fold because it keeps the same ratio of various kinds of data points.

clone does deep copy. 

If you dont know what to compare with your model - choose logistic regression. 

Dependent variable is the class.

The parameters used to tune a machine learning model are called hyperparameter.


For NLP, use SVM.
